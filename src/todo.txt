*Implement spritesheet loading for animation/frames
*Implement loading fighters from files
*Check out a non-virtual interface for fighter_state class
       (Having to explicitly call Update() in each child class's overridden Update() is a bug-prone)

Potential optimization issues
*Resizing sprite texture bounding box every time the texture is changed (which is every frame for every sprite)

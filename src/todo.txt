*Implement spritesheet loading for animation/frames
*Implement loading fighters from files
*Check out a non-virtual interface for fighter_state class
       (Having to explicitly call Update() in each child class's overridden Update() is bug-prone)   
*Implement hitbox importing from .ani files as well as hitbox drawing

Potential optimization issues
*Resizing sprite texture bounding box every time the texture is changed
       (which happens every frame for every sprite, currently)
